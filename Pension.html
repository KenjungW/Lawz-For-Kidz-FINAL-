                    <h3>Facts</h3>
                    <p>In 2017, new PIP regulations excluded those whose mobility issues stemmed from psychological distress. RF, granted anonymity, challenged the rule, arguing it unfairly discriminated against disabled individuals and sought to have it overturned.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Arguments</h3>
                    <p>The Secretary of State argued the change was a necessary welfare reform expected to save £1 billion annually. RF contended it was discriminatory, breached human rights law, and exceeded the Secretary’s legal authority.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Judgement</h3>
                    <p>The High Court ruled in favor of RF, finding the regulations unlawfully discriminatory toward disabled people. The court held that financial savings could not justify such unequal treatment, and the regulations were quashed.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Impact</h3>
                        <p>The ruling was widely celebrated by disability rights advocates. Organizations like Inclusion London and DPAC praised it as a landmark victory, strengthening protections against government discrimination toward people with disabilities.</p>
